# cemplate

Simple C++ template engine

## Description

This project aims to simplify the process of writing C++ code generating
programs. It provides basic primitives to describe the language constructs
without worrying about the indentation, opening and closing scopes and spacing.

The project is still in raw form, a proof of concept, just enough to work with
my other projects.  It's not complete by any means, and there is probably going
to be a major reimagination some time in the future.
